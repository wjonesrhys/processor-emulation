processor emulation
this project has two python files. 

create_database.py 
creates an SQLite database, generating and adding tasks to newly created table called SimulationData.
it populates the table with a task number, a unique ID, task duration and end time

run_processors.py 
imports the queue module to create one and add all the tasks to the queue ordered by arrival time
has a System class that utilises 3 instances of the Processor class in the same file
this goes through the tasks in the queue based on a running clock
the system checks whether there are processors free or not to determine whether to assign the task to a processor, if not they are placed on hold
if there is one free, it will sit running until the end time and then be removed

This was a university project and some point may need refactoring a little.
